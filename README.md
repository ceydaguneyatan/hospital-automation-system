# hospital-automation-system
A hospital automation system that patients and doctors can use.
Patients can register for the app by entering their personal information. They can then log in with their registered password. When they want to make an appointment, there are hospital, polyclinic, doctor and time options to choose from. When a patient makes an appointment, the appointment at that time appears in red on the other patient's screen as full. If the patient wants to make an appointment again with the same options, he/she can make an appointment from the “make an appointment again” option without having to enter the same information. List the appointments according to hospital, doctor and polyclinic criteria. If he/she has allergies, he/she can enter and update his/her personal information. In the same way, a doctor can enter his user information and see the list of patients he will examine. He can select that patient, write a prescription and send this prescription to the patient's system for the patient to see. It also stores all this data in MySQL, a database management system. This project is in java software language using Apache netbeans ide using mysql database.
